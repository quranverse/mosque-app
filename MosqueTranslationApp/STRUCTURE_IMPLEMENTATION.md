# Mosque App Structure Implementation

Based on your UI design requirements, I've implemented the following structure:

## 🕌 Main Features Implemented

### 1. Prayer Times Screen (`src/screens/PrayerTimesScreen.js`)
**Main screen matching your design:**
- **Top Left Icon**: Mosque management button (❤️) for follow/unfollow functionality
- **Top Center**: Mosque name with swipe gesture to switch between followed mosques
- **Current Time Display**: Large time format (01:55) with Hijri and Gregorian dates
- **Prayer Times List**: Shows all 5 prayers with next prayer highlighted
- **Bottom Navigation**: Tab navigation similar to your design

**Key Features:**
- Swipe left/right to switch between followed mosques
- Real-time clock updates
- Next prayer countdown
- Arabic prayer names
- Visual indicators for mosque switching

### 2. Mosque Management Screen (`src/screens/MosqueManagementScreen.js`)
**Accessed via the top-left heart icon:**
- **Following Tab**: Shows currently followed mosques
- **Discover Tab**: Find new mosques to follow/unfollow
- **Search Functionality**: Search by mosque name, imam, or location
- **Follow/Unfollow Buttons**: Easy mosque management
- **Mosque Details**: Distance, languages, imam info, follower count

### 3. Enhanced Live Translation
**Horizontal translation view for live broadcasts:**
- Full-screen landscape mode
- Real-time translation display
- Audio controls and connection status
- Gesture-based controls

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

The following packages were added:
- `react-native-gesture-handler` - For swipe gestures
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - For data persistence

## 🚀 Next Steps

To complete the implementation:
1. **Connect to real prayer time API**
2. **Implement actual mosque database**
3. **Add push notifications for prayer times**
4. **Enhance gesture animations**
5. **Add location-based mosque discovery**

## 📋 Features Matching Your Design

✅ **Top left icon for mosque management**
✅ **Mosque name with swipe switching**
✅ **Prayer times display with highlighting**
✅ **Current time in large format**
✅ **Bottom navigation tabs**

The implementation closely follows your UI design with the mosque management icon in the top left, swipeable mosque name in the center, and a clean prayer times display that matches the visual style you showed in the image.
