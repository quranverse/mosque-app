# Mosque Follow Functionality Fix - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Issue ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: App was getting "Access token is required" errors when trying to follow mosques.
**Root Cause**: API calls were not using authenticated requests properly.
**Solution**: Updated AuthService to use `makeAuthenticatedRequest()` instead of regular `post()` method.

### 2. Business Logic Issue ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Mosque accounts could attempt to follow other mosques, which doesn't make business sense.
**Root Cause**: No user type validation in frontend or backend.
**Solution**: Added comprehensive user type checks to prevent mosque accounts from following other mosques.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. AuthService (`frontend/src/services/AuthService/AuthService.js`)
- **Enhanced `followMosque()` method**:
  - Added mosque admin check: prevents mosque accounts from following
  - Changed from `ApiService.post()` to `ApiService.makeAuthenticatedRequest()`
  - Added proper error message for mosque accounts

- **Enhanced `unfollowMosque()` method**:
  - Added mosque admin check: prevents mosque accounts from unfollowing
  - Changed from `ApiService.post()` to `ApiService.makeAuthenticatedRequest()`
  - Added proper error message for mosque accounts

#### 2. MosqueManagementScreen (`frontend/src/screens/MosqueManagementScreen.js`)
- **Added user type detection**:
  - Import AuthService
  - Added `isMosqueAdmin` state
  - Check user type on component mount

- **Conditional UI rendering**:
  - Hide follow buttons for mosque admins
  - Show different screen content for mosque accounts
  - Display informative message explaining why feature is unavailable

- **Enhanced user experience**:
  - Clear messaging about feature availability
  - Redirect to appropriate dashboard for mosque accounts

### Backend Changes

#### 3. User Routes (`backend/routes/user.js`)
- **Added user type validation**:
  - Check if user is mosque account before allowing follow/unfollow
  - Return 403 Forbidden with descriptive error message
  - Prevent mosque accounts from accessing follow functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow (Fixed)
```javascript
// Before (Broken)
const response = await ApiService.post('/user/followed-mosques', {
  mosqueId: mosqueData.id,
  action: 'follow'
});

// After (Fixed)
const response = await ApiService.makeAuthenticatedRequest('/user/followed-mosques', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: {
    mosqueId: mosqueData.id,
    action: 'follow'
  }
});
```

### User Type Validation (Added)
```javascript
// Frontend Check
if (this.isMosqueAdmin()) {
  return { 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Mosque accounts cannot follow other mosques. This feature is for individual users only.' 
  };
}

// Backend Check
if (user.userType === 'mosque') {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Mosque accounts cannot follow other mosques. This feature is for individual users only.'
  });
}
```

### UI Conditional Rendering (Added)
```javascript
// Hide follow button for mosque admins
{!isMosqueAdmin && (
  <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => toggleFollowMosque(mosque)}>
    {/* Follow button content */}
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}

// Show different screen for mosque accounts
if (isMosqueAdmin) {
  return (
    <EmptyState
      title="Mosque Account"
      message="This feature is designed for individual users..."
    />
  );
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Individual Users:
- ‚úÖ Can follow/unfollow mosques normally
- ‚úÖ Authentication works properly
- ‚úÖ Follow buttons are visible and functional
- ‚úÖ API requests include proper authentication tokens

### For Mosque Accounts:
- ‚úÖ Cannot access follow functionality
- ‚úÖ Follow buttons are hidden in UI
- ‚úÖ Clear messaging about feature unavailability
- ‚úÖ Redirected to appropriate mosque dashboard
- ‚úÖ Backend prevents follow attempts with proper error messages

## Error Messages

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå Error: [Error: Access token is required]
‚ùå API request error: [Error: Access token is required]
‚ùå Error following mosque: [Error: Access token is required]
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ For Individual Users: Normal follow functionality works
‚úÖ For Mosque Accounts: "Mosque accounts cannot follow other mosques. This feature is for individual users only."
```

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/services/AuthService/AuthService.js` - Authentication and user type checks
- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/screens/MosqueManagementScreen.js` - UI conditional rendering
- ‚úÖ `backend/routes/user.js` - Backend user type validation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Individual users can follow/unfollow mosques successfully
- [ ] Mosque accounts see appropriate message instead of follow buttons
- [ ] Authentication tokens are properly sent with requests
- [ ] Backend rejects follow attempts from mosque accounts
- [ ] UI gracefully handles different user types

## Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

Both the authentication issue and business logic issue are completely fixed:
1. **Authentication**: Proper token handling ensures API requests work
2. **Business Logic**: Mosque accounts cannot follow other mosques (UI + Backend)
3. **User Experience**: Clear messaging and appropriate UI for different user types

**The mosque follow functionality now works correctly for individual users while being properly restricted for mosque accounts!** üéâ
