# Network Connectivity Solution ‚úÖ

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: App crashes with "Request timeout" errors when changing IP addresses or internet connections.

**Root Cause**: The app was using hardcoded IP addresses that became invalid when switching networks.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic IP detection with automatic network change handling.

## How the New System Works

### 1. Automatic IP Detection
The app now automatically detects the best available IP address by:
- Extracting IP from Metro bundler (development)
- Using React Native NetInfo for network details
- Testing multiple fallback IPs
- Choosing the first working connection

### 2. Network Change Monitoring
- Monitors network state changes in real-time
- Automatically refreshes API connections when network changes
- Handles WiFi ‚Üî Cellular transitions seamlessly
- Detects IP address changes within the same network

### 3. Smart Retry Logic
- Automatically retries failed requests with fresh IP detection
- Uses exponential backoff for retries
- Fails fast on non-network errors
- Provides detailed error logging

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **`frontend/src/config/api.js`** - Dynamic IP detection system
2. **`frontend/src/services/ApiService/ApiService.js`** - Smart retry logic
3. **`frontend/src/services/NetworkService/`** - Network monitoring service
4. **`frontend/App.js`** - Network service integration

### New Dependencies:
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` - For network state monitoring

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test Network Changes
1. **WiFi to Cellular**: Switch from WiFi to mobile data
2. **Different WiFi**: Connect to a different WiFi network
3. **IP Change**: Restart your router to get a new IP
4. **Airplane Mode**: Turn airplane mode on/off

### Expected Behavior:
- App should automatically detect network changes
- API requests should continue working after network switches
- Console should show network change detection logs
- No more "Request timeout" crashes

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still Get Connection Errors:

1. **Check Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   Make sure it's running on `0.0.0.0:8080` (all interfaces)

2. **Force Refresh Connection**:
   - Restart the app
   - Or change networks to trigger auto-detection

3. **Manual IP Check** (Legacy):
   ```bash
   node update-ip-config.js
   ```

4. **Check Console Logs**:
   Look for these messages:
   - `üåê Starting network monitoring...`
   - `üîÑ Network state changed:`
   - `‚úÖ Using [detected/fallback] IP: X.X.X.X`

### Common Network Scenarios:

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Change WiFi | ‚ùå Crashes | ‚úÖ Auto-detects new IP |
| WiFi ‚Üí Cellular | ‚ùå Crashes | ‚úÖ Switches seamlessly |
| Router restart | ‚ùå Crashes | ‚úÖ Detects new IP |
| VPN on/off | ‚ùå Crashes | ‚úÖ Adapts to new route |

## Technical Details

### IP Detection Priority:
1. Metro bundler IP (development)
2. NetInfo detected IP
3. Fallback IPs: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.2.2`, etc.
4. Last resort: `localhost`

### Network Change Detection:
- Connection status changes
- Internet reachability changes
- Network type changes (WiFi/Cellular)
- IP address changes

### Retry Strategy:
- Max 2 retries per request
- Refresh IP detection between retries
- 1-2 second delays between attempts
- Fast fail for non-network errors

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No More Crashes**: App handles network changes gracefully
‚úÖ **Zero Configuration**: Works automatically without manual setup
‚úÖ **Better UX**: Seamless transitions between networks
‚úÖ **Robust**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
‚úÖ **Development Friendly**: Works with Metro bundler IP detection
‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Configurable for deployed environments

**The app should now work reliably across all network changes! üéâ**
