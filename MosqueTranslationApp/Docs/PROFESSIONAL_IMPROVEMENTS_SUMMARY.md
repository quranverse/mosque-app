# Professional Mosque App Improvements - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **Completed Professional Improvements**

### 1. **Navigation Structure Cleanup** âœ…
- **Removed Demo/StructureDemo screen** completely from production
- **Implemented 5-tab navigation structure** that differs based on user type:
  - **Mosque Accounts**: Prayer Times (default), Broadcasting, Announcements, Qibla, Settings
  - **Individual Accounts**: Prayer Times (default), Translation, Announcements, Qibla, Settings
- **Added proper tab icons** for better UX
- **Conditional rendering** based on user authentication type

### 2. **Mosque Account Functionality Redesign** âœ…
- **Removed "Mosque Control" screen** completely
- **Removed all translation reception features** from mosque accounts
- **Replaced "Translation" tab with "Broadcasting" tab** for mosque accounts

- **Enabled mosques to start live audio broadcasts** that individual users can join

### 3. **Individual Account Functionality** âœ…
- **Kept existing "Translation" tab** for individual users only
- **Maintained mosque following/management functionality** (heart icon)
- **Preserved horizontal translation screen** for receiving live translations

### 5. **User Type Logic Implementation** âœ…
